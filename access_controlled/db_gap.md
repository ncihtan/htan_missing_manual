To get started on your dbGaP request, first navigate to the HTAN dbGap page at: [phs002371.v1.p1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002371.v1.p1), and click the **Request Access** button. You will be prompted to login to dbGaP. Once logged in, click the **Create New Research Project** button, and follow the on-screen application process.

As per dbGaP instructions, you will be prompted for relevant information, including:

-   A research statement and a nontechnical summary statement describing your planned use of the data.
