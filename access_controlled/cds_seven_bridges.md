# Cancer Data Service and Seven Bridges Genomics

While you are awaiting your dbGap approval, it is recommended that you head to the [Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/), and register a new account. Note that you will do so with the same ERA Commons account used to submit your dbGaP application.

Once your dbGaP application has been approved, you can access HTAN data via the **Cancer Data Service browser** within the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud. To do so, head to [Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/), and log in with your ERA Commons credentials.

Once logged in, navigate to the top navigation bar, and select **Data > Cancer Data Service Explorer**.
