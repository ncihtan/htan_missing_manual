# Data Levels and Clinical Data Tiers

The [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) pages of the HTAN Data Portal provide a detailed overview of the HTAN Data Model. A general overview of how the HTAN Data Model is organized is provided on this page.

## Assay Data Levels
The HTAN Data Model divides assay data into levels. Each assay type has levels progressing from raw data to more processed data.  This is illustrated in the following figure for sequencing data.  Please see each assay's page within [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) for more information.

For Sequencing data, the HTAN Model Data levels help distinguish data as Open Access versus Controlled Access.  For example, level 1 and 2 sequencing data are Controlled Access data.     

## Clinical Data Tiers
Clinical data is organized into three tiers.  Tier one is based on the NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC) clinical data model.  Tiers two and three are disease-agnostic (tier 2) and disease-specific (tier 3) extensions to the GDC model. These tiers are described more on the [Clinical Data Page](https://humantumoratlas.org/standard/clinical).
