# Data Standards

This page is a place holder for a data standards page/set of data standards pages similar to [MC2 Center Data Model](https://mc2-center.github.io/data-models/).  The HTAN version of the MC2 tables will include additional columns such as "required_if_component" and "required_if_value".  Until the new pages are constructed, please see the information on the [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) page of the HTAN Data Portal.

The HTAN data model includes data levels. Each assay type has levels progressing from raw data to more processed data.  This is illustrated in the following figure for sequencing data.  Please see the [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) page of the HTAN Data Portal for more information.

!!! Note
Once new data standards pages are added to this manual, the [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) page will be removed from the data portal.  All links to "Data Standards" throughout this manual will need to be updated.
