# Biospecimen Metadata

The HTAN biospecimen data model is designed to capture essential biospecimen data elements, including:

-   Acquisition method, e.g. autopsy, biopsy, fine needle aspirate, etc.
-   Topography Code, indicating site within the body, e.g. based on [ICD-O-3](https://seer.cancer.gov/icd-o-3/).
-   Collection information e.g. time, duration of ischemia, temperature, etc.
-   Processing of parent biospecimen information e.g. fresh, frozen, etc.
-   Biospecimen and derivative clinical metadata ie Histologic Morphology Code, e.g. based on [ICD-O-3](https://seer.cancer.gov/icd-o-3/).
-   Coordinates for derivative biospecimen from their parent biospecimen.
-   Processing of derivative biospecimen for downstream analysis e.g. dissociation, sectioning, analyte isolation, etc.
