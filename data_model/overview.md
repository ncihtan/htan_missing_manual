# Data Model Introduction

All HTAN Centers are required to encode their data and metadata in a **common HTAN Data Model**. The HTAN Data Model is created via a community Request for Comment (RFC) process, with participation from all HTAN Centers, and covers clinical, biospecimen, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging and spatial profiling data.

HTAN has had two phases:
- HTAN Phase 2 (2025-present)
- HTAN Phase 1 (2018-2025)

!!! Data Standards
Complete information regarding the HTAN Phase 1 Data Model and specific data elements is available at: https://data.humantumoratlas.org/standards. 

This manual and the HTAN Data Portal standards pages will be updated as the Phase 2 Data Model is implemented.

## HTAN Phase 2 Data Model

In HTAN Phase 2, the Data Model is being updated with three main aims:
1. Align the HTAN Data Model with the NCI's Cancer Research Data Commons ([CRDC](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/)) standards. 
2. Add or enhance existing standards to accommodate new assays. 
3. Refine and strengthen the model to support FAIR data sharing principles, by 
    - eliminating unused attributes;
    - changing requirements and valid values; 
    - clarifying attribute definitions; and
    - standardizing data file formats where possible. 

## HTAN Phase 1 Data Model

Where possible, the HTAN Phase 1 Data Model leveraged previously defined data standards across the scientific research community, including the [NCI Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov/), the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/), the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) and the [Minimum Information about Tissue Imaging (MITI)](https://www.miti-consortium.org/) reporting guidelines.
