# Data Model

All HTAN Centers are required to encode their data and metadata in the **common HTAN Data Model**. The HTAN Data Model was created via a community Request for Comment (RFC) process, with participation from all HTAN Centers, and covers clinical data, biospecimen data, genomic data and multiplex imaging data.

As much as possible, the HTAN Data Model leverages previously defined data standards across the scientific research community, including the [NCI Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov/), the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/), the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) and the [Minimum Information about Tissue Imaging (MITI)](https://www.miti-consortium.org/) reporting guidelines.
