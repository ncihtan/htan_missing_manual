# Relationship Model

Each atlas in HTAN contains data provided by multiple research participants, who have donated biospecimens (see Figure below). The metadata allows one to trace back any data file to the donated biospecimen. Level 1 raw data files are directly linked to the corresponding biospecimen, whereas processed level 2-4 data files are linked to lower level parent data files. Note also that biospecimens can be connected recursively.
