# Clinical Metadata

The HTAN clinical data model consists of three tiers. Tier 1 is in alignment with the [Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/) guidelines for clinical data, while Tiers 2 and 3 are HTAN extensions to the GDC model.

| Tier | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
