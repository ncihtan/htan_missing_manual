## Assay Data Levels
The HTAN Data Model divides assay data into levels. Each assay type has levels progressing from raw data to more processed data.  This is illustrated in Figure 4 for sequencing data.  Please see each assay's page within [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) for more information.

For Sequencing data, the HTAN Model Data levels help distinguish data as [open access versus access-controlled](../data_access/introduction.md).  For example, level 1 and 2 sequencing data are access-controlled data.
