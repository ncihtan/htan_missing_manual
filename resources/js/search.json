Five of the research centers are focused on developing pre-cancer atlases, and the remaining five centers are focused on developing tumor atlases. We also have two pilot projects, one focused on pre-cancer atlases, and one focused on tumor atlases.","Each research center is responsible for gathering and processing samples, and running their own experimental assays. Assays vary by center, but most centers have a strong focus on single cell RNA-Seq and a wide range of multiplex imaging modalities.","All centers are required to submit their clinical, biospecimen and assay data to the HTAN DCC using a common HTAN Data Model. The DCC makes HTAN data available to the wider scientific community.","Complete information regarding HTAN is available at: https://humantumoratlas.org/.","Please see HTAN Data: A Gentle Introduction for an overview of HTAN Data.","You can explore all open access data within the HTAN Data Portal at: https://humantumoratlas.org/explore.","A complete list of HTAN Publications is available on Google Scholar.","The current status of data uploads (refreshed every 4 hours) is available on the HTAN Dashboard."]}],[{"l":"HTAN Centers","p":["Area of Focus","Atlas Type","Boston University","Breast","Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia","Colorectal","Contact Institution or Project Name","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute","Duke University","Familial Adenomatous Polyposis","For details on each center, please see: https://humantumoratlas.org/research-network.","Harvard Medical School","HTA1","HTA10","HTA11","HTA12","HTA13","HTA14","HTA15","HTA16","HTA2","HTA3","HTA4","HTA5","HTA6","HTA7","HTA8","HTA9","HTAN currently consists of ten research centers, and two pilot projects.
