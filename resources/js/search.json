Five of the research centers are focused on developing pre-cancer atlases, and the remaining five centers are focused on developing tumor atlases. We also have two pilot projects, one focused on pre-cancer atlases, and one focused on tumor atlases.","Each research center is responsible for gathering and processing samples, and running their own experimental assays. Assays vary by center, but most centers have a strong focus on single cell RNA-Seq and a wide range of multiplex imaging modalities.","All centers are required to submit their clinical, biospecimen and assay data to the HTAN DCC using a common HTAN Data Model.

An Associate Membership Policy provides a mechanism for experts from outside of HTAN to contribute their expertise and knowledge. In addition, specific policies related to publications and the sharing of research protocols and computational tools were developed. A key infrastructure component for the implementation of these data-sharing policies is the Synapse platform, which provides fine-grained access controls at individual and team levels to ensure that data contributors and DCC staff have appropriate access to their data. Synapse teams were used to enable project-level access and tracked against a table of HTAN membership.","Ensuring the privacy of HTAN research participants is critical and a joint responsibility of the HTAN Centers generating data and the DCC. HTAN Centers are required to fully de-identify data before submission to the DCC via the Synapse platform, and must describe their data and metadata de-identification process in a de-identification plan. Following data submission, the DCC is responsible for implementing additional checks, to ensure patient privacy. Verifying that HTAN imaging data is de-identified is a particular focus of the DCC. For example, the extensive metadata collected alongside HTAN data was noted to theoretically enable the reconstruction of HIPAA-protected dates (such as participant date of birth) from the date of imaging data acquisition through longitudinal metadata attributes.
