However, a free account is needed for accessing data on Synapse, and access-controlled data requires an approved dbGap request. See the Data Access section for more information."]},{"l":"How is the data on the HTAN Portal generated?","p":["The data is collected from participating HTAN centers across the United States. These centers generate multi-omics data, imaging datasets, and other relevant tumor information using advanced technologies, such as single-cell sequencing, proteomics, and spatial imaging techniques."]},{"l":"Can I upload my own data to the HTAN Portal?","p":["At this time, the HTAN Portal does not support user-uploaded data"]},{"l":"Is there any support or documentation available for using the HTAN Portal?","p":["Yes, the HTAN Portal offers extensive documentation to help users navigate and utilize the platform effectively, including this Manual. Additionally, the portal provides a Help Desk for support."]},{"l":"How is privacy and data security handled on the HTAN Portal?","p":["The HTAN Portal adheres to strict data security and privacy protocols to ensure that sensitive information, including patient-related data, is protected. Any identifiable information is removed or de-identified before being made available to the public, in compliance with ethical standards and legal regulations. More information can be found in the Governance and Policy section."]},{"l":"Can I use HTAN data for my own research?","p":["Yes, researchers are encouraged to use HTAN data for their own studies. The data is publicly available, but users must acknowledge HTAN and the publication of the source data in any resulting publications. Please see Citing HTAN for more information."]},{"l":"Where can I find updates on new data or features added to the HTAN Portal?","p":["The portal is regularly updated with new data and features. You can find updates in the News section of the HTAN Portal."]},{"l":"Is there healthy data?","p":["There is \"healthy\" and precancerous data on the HTAN Portal. No specific “healthy” filter exists at the moment, but one can find all samples without an unknown or reported disease with this HTAN portal filter. Note however that some of these may be tumors of unknown primary, or the information is missing for another reason. There is an open ticket to improve the selection of healthy/normal and precancerous tissue."]},{"l":"Is there 3D data?","p":["A number of three-dimensional datasets have been released on the HTAN data portal, including 3D microscopy data and serial sections for H&E and multiplexed tissue imaging. Examples include multiple serial section of CRC analyzed by CyCIF for the SARDANA trans-network partnership, and electron microscopy data from OHSU. The DCC expects to receive and share 3D datasets including confocal and light-sheet microscopy in the future."]},{"l":"Is there temporal data?","p":["There are a few different types of temporal data, e.g., precancerous vs cancerous tumors, primary vs metastatic tumor samples, as well as a patient's longitudinal treatment and diagnosis information. The former can be found by search for specific biospecimens. The latter can now be explored per atlas in the longitudinal data section of the HTAN Data Submission Dashboard, as well as on cBioPortal for the OHSU breast cancer dataset. We are working on improving the search and filter capabilities for temporal data on the HTAN Portal."]},{"l":"How can I contact the HTAN team for additional questions?","p":["You can contact the HTAN team through the Help Desk"]}]]
