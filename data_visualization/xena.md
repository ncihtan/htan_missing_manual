# Visualizing Data via Xena

[Xena](https://xena.ucsc.edu/) is a platform developed by the University of California Santa Cruz Genomics Institute to support visualization and analysis of multiomics data. Please see their [tutorial pages](https://ucsc-xena.gitbook.io/project/tutorials) for more information regarding the type of analyses possible in Xena.

A subset of HTAN single cell/single nuclei RNA-sequencing and t-CYCIF data has been submitted to Xena. These datasets can be found on Xena either by accessing them through the HTAN Portal or searching for "HTAN" on Xena.
