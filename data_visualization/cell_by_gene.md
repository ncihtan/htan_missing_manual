# Visualizing Single Cell Data via CellxGene

Through our collaboration with the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)</a>, we make HTAN single cell RNA seq data available via <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CellxGene</a>. CellxGene enables you to visualize and explore large-scale single cell data sets. For complete details on CellxGene, please refer to the <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/docs/01__CellxGene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online documentation</a>.

HTAN data sets with CellxGene visualization are denoted on the main home page in the rightmost column. Clicking the CellxGene logo will take you directly to CellxGene.
