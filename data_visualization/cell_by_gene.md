# Visualizing Single Cell Data via CellxGene

Through our collaboration with the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/), we make HTAN single cell RNA seq data available via [CellxGene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/). CellxGene enables you to visualize and explore large-scale single cell data sets. For complete details on CellxGene, please refer to the [online documentation](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/docs/01__CellxGene).

HTAN data sets with CellxGene visualization are denoted on the main home page in the rightmost column. Clicking the CellxGene logo will take you directly to CellxGene.
