# HTAN Data Levels

HTAN data is categorized into **two data access levels**:

-   **Open access**: includes de-identified clinical and biospecimen data, multiplex images, and processed genomic data. This data is available via the HTAN Data Portal. See [Open Access Data](/open_access/introduction.md).

-   **Access controlled**: includes unprocessed genomic data, e.g. BAM files. Similar to TCGA BAM files, this data is available via an approved dbGaP mechanism. See [Controlled-Access Data](/access_controlled/introduction.md).
