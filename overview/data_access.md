# HTAN Data Access and Data Releases

HTAN data is categorized into **two data access levels**:

-   **Open access**: includes de-identified clinical and biospecimen data, multiplex images, and processed genomic data.  

-   **Access controlled**: includes unprocessed genomic data, e.g. BAM files. Similar to TCGA BAM files, this data is available via an approved dbGaP mechanism. 

HTAN provides multiple mechanisms to explore and access data. Please see the [Data Access](../data_access/introduction.md) section of this manual for more information.
