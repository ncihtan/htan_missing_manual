# Introduction to HTAN

The **Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)** is a National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Moonshot initiative focused on studying the **transitions of human cancers** as they evolve from **precancerous lesions to advanced disease**.

In the current phase of HTAN (Phase 2), the network consists of **ten research centers** and a **Data Coordinating Center (DCC)**. Five of the research centers are focused on developing **pre-cancer atlases**, and the remaining five centers are focused on developing **tumor atlases**.

Each research center is responsible for gathering and processing samples, and running their own experimental assays. Assays vary by center, but most centers have a strong focus on **spatial profiling** and **single cell RNA-Seq**.

All centers are required to submit their clinical, biospecimen and assay data to the HTAN DCC using a **common HTAN Data Model**. The DCC makes HTAN data available to the wider scientific community.
