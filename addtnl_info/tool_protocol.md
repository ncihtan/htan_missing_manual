## Research Protocols

HTAN Centers are encouraged to document their research protocols in protocols.io. Assay metadata submitted to HTAN requires a Protocols.io ID or DOI link to a free/open protocol resource describing in detail the assay protocol and/or the protocol by which the sample was obtained or generated.
