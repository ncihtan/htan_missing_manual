# Submitting Tools and Protocols

## Computational Tools
he [Analysis Tools page](https://humantumoratlas.org/tools) lists computational tools developed or used to support HTAN research project. The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) regularly checks HTAN pre-prints and publications for new HTAN Tools to add to the page. HTAN Centers may also contact Alex Lash at alexl@ds.dfci.harvard.edu if they have tools to add to the Catalog.

## Research Protocols

HTAN Centers are encouraged to document their research protocols in protocols.io. Assay metadata submitted to HTAN requires a Protocols.io ID or DOI link to a free/open protocol resource describing in detail the assay protocol and/or the protocol by which the sample was obtained or generated.
