# Trans-Network Projects (TNPs)
Trans-Network Projects are multi-center projects created to facilitate collaborative research.  Examples include cross-testing experimental and analytical protocols, exchange of personnel to disseminate SOPs or pursuit of additional HTAN critical methods or technologies.  Specific information about each TNP is available on the Synapse wiki pages for HTAN members. 

- **Phase 1 TNPs**: [Synapse HTAN Phase 1 Wiki page](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn17022193/wiki/584990). 
- **Phase 2 TNPs**: [Synapse HTAN Phase 2 Wiki page](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn63296487/wiki/629655). \
:warning:  Currently there are no TNPs associated with Phase 2.

The HTAN Synapse Wiki page is restricted to HTAN members.  Please contact htandcc@ds.dfci.harvard.edu if you are a member of HTAN and need access to the wiki.

Current Trans-Network Projects (Phase 1)

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| HTA13 | TNP SARDANA | The **S**h**a**red **R**epositories, **D**ata, **An**alysis and **A**ccess TNP focuses on optimizing the repeatability, interpretability and accessibility of HTAN characterization methods and the data they generate.  |
| HTA14 | TNP TMA | The **T**issue **M**icro**A**rray TNP extends the TNP SARDANA characterization and analytics methodologies for evaluation and validation to a large array of breast tumor TMA samples that provide a broad spectrum of disease states and subtypes. |
| HTA15 | TNP SRRS | The **S**tandardized **R**epository of **R**eference **S**pecimens TNP's mission is to assemble an extensive catalogue of cases from premalignant lesions, pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue and metastatic tumor tissue for protocol optimization and validation. |
| HTA16 | TNP CASI | The goal of the **C**ell **A**nnotations and **S**ignatures **I**nitiative TNP is to provide robust and accurate tools for cell type annotation from single-cell data. |
