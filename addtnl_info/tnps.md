# Trans-Network Projects (TNPs)
Trans-Network Projects are multi-center projects created to facilitate collaborative research, such as cross-testing of experimental and analytical protocols, exchange of personnel to disseminate SOPs, or pursuit of additional HTAN critical methods or technologies.  Specific information about each TNP is available on [HTAN's Synapse Wiki page](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn17022193/wiki/584990) for HTAN members. 

!!! Note

The HTAN Synapse Wiki page is restricted to HTAN members.  Please contact htandcc@ds.dfci.harvard.edu if you are a member of HTAN and need access to the wiki.

Current Trans-Network Projects

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| HTA13 | TNP SARDANA | The **S**h**a**red **R**epositories, **D**ata, **An**alysis and **A**ccess TNP focuses on optimizing the repeatability, interpretability and accessibility of HTAN characterization methods and the data they generate.  |
| HTA14 | TNP TMA | The **T**issue **M**icro**A**rray TNP extends the TNP SARDANA characterization and analytics methodologies for evaluation and validation to a large array of breast tumor TMA samples that provide a broad spectrum of disease states and subtypes. |
| HTA15 | TNP SRRS | The **S**tandardized **R**epository of **R**eference **S**pecimens TNP's mission is to assemble an extensive catalogue of cases from premalignant lesions, pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue and metastatic tumor tissue for protocol optimization and validation. |
| HTA16 | TNP CASI | The goal of the **C**ell **A**nnotations and **S**ignatures **I**nitiative TNP is to provide robust and accurate tools for cell type annotation from single-cell data. |
