# The RFC Process and Data Model Changes

## RFC Overview
The HTAN Data Model is expected to evolve with advances in science.  This evolution is a community-driven, peer-reviewed process, where members of a working group will first assess established community data standards and create a request for comment (RFC) document soliciting community feedback.

Once an RFC is closed and an assay is available for data submission, the final data model is documented in this manual ([Data Model](../data_model/overview.md)) and detailed documentation of metadata requirements is provided in the  <a href="https://htan2-data-model.readthedocs.io/en/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTAN Phase 2 Data Model (Metadata) Documentation</a>.

## Data Model Changes
The following are requests which require changes to the Data Model and may result in the initiation of a RFC:

- New assay types which are expected to be used frequently by multiple centers.
- New metadata templates or additional required metadata fields which should be validated.

HTAN members should contact their [data liaison](../data_submission/Data_Liaisons.md) for help determining whether a Data Model change is needed and how to make a Data Model change request.  

## RFC Process 
Once a new assay type or a set of needed Data Model changes are identified, an RFC is drafted. For the initial development of the HTAN Data Model in Phase 1, the RFC process started with the creation of a Working Group comprised of DCC members and PIs as well as HTAN Center co-authors. This process is outlined in [RFC Process -- Initial Model Development](#phase-1-rfc-process----initial-data-model-development). In Phase 2, a more streamlined RFC Process has been adopted to facilitate [Data Model Refinements](#phase-2-rfc-process----data-model-refinements).  

### Phase 2 RFC Process -- Data Model Refinements
1. A **DCC Owner** is assigned. The **DCC Owner** is responsible for all aspects of the RFC process, including creating the initial draft of the RFC, integrating community feedback, finalizing the RFC and documenting RFC implementation and changes.  The DCC Owner is also the primary point of contact for the specified RFC.
2. **A first draft of an RFC Google Document is created** by the DCC Owner. If the RFC involves new assay types or HTAN Center requests, the DCC Owner works with HTAN Centers to understand requirements as a part of the drafting process. 
3. **The DCC reviews and approves the RFC draft.**  
4. **The RFC is open for public comment**. All HTAN members can provide suggestions by adding comments directly to the document.
5. After a designated period of time, the **RFC is closed**.  Feedback from HTAN community is no longer accepted. The content of the RFC will be reflected in the respective version of the HTAN Data Model used for validating metadata files uploaded to the DCC.
6. **The new or modified metadata template is available in Synapse.**


### Phase 1 RFC Process -- Initial Data Model Development
1. **A working group is organized** by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC).  As a part of this process, the following people are also designated:
    * A **DCC Owner**, who is responsible for finalizing the RFC and overall accepting/rejecting/integrating community feedback.  The DCC Owner is also the primary point of contact for the specified RFC.
    * A **single DCC PI**, to monitor progress towards completion.
    * One or more **Co-Authors** from one or more HTAN centers, to help draft the RFC. Representatives from each HTAN center help identify individuals at their center who can contribute to a particular RFC.
2. **A first draft of an RFC Google Document is created** based upon feedback from the working group.
3. **The RFC is open for public comment**. All HTAN members can provide suggestions by adding comments directly to the document.
4. After a designated period of time, the **RFC is closed**.  Feedback from HTAN community is no longer accepted. The content of the RFC will be reflected in the respective version of the HTAN Data Model used for validating metadata files uploaded to the DCC.
5. The metadata template is available on the Data Curator App (DCA).
