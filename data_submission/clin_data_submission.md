# Phase 2 Clinical Data Submission

In HTAN Phase 2, there are only two clinical metadata tiers. 
- Tier 1 metadata is divided into multiple categories, including Demographics, Diagosis, Family History, Exposure, Molecular Test, Therapy, Follow Up and Vital Status. 
- Tier 2 contains any cancer or study-specific clinical information which is not represented in Tier 1. Tier 2 is a flexible comma-separated value (csv) file. The only required attribute is HTAN Participant ID. All other attributes (columns headers) are determined by the submitting Center. 

Figure 2 provides a general representation of the model.
