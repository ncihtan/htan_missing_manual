# Introduction
Only HTAN Centers and Associate Members can submit data to HTAN repositories. The Data Submission Section of this Manual is intended as a guide for HTAN Centers and Associate Members. Please note that the manual is currently in the process of being updated to Phase 2 methods for data submission.

:exclamation: *Prior to submitting data, all data must be de-identified.  Please see [Data De-identification](../data_submission/Data_Deidentification.md) for more information.*


## Phase 2 Data and Metadata Submission
In HTAN Phase 2, data and metadata submission are centralized within the Synapse platform which is developed and maintained by [Sage Bionetworks](https://sagebionetworks.org/). 

Assay Data Submission involves uploading the data files and then annotating those files with required metadata. (Figure 1) Additional metadata for the Clinical and Biospecimen modules of the HTAN2 Data Model are submitted via Synapse as **Record-based** metadata. (Figure 2)

Specific details regarding data submission and the DCA will be included in later sections of this manual.  Please contact your [Data Liaison](../data_submission/Data_Liaisons.md) if you have any questions or issues.  Please also keep your data liaison informed of any expected data submissions.
