| I understand the data I contribute will be hosted and shared via the HTAN-DCC Portal or other HTAN-designated repositories and will be subject to and governed by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the NIH Data Sharing Policy and NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. | [HTAN DMSA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPFm9MBJv8DjZmYZyIv0jbjtNJ8fnwGjYDjlK4lL4nc/edit)Section 3.a: ”Any Data that Contributor generates as part of the HTAN Project will be hosted and shared using the HTAN-DCC Portal or other HTAN-designated repositories and will be subject to and governed by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the NIH Data Sharing Policy and NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy.”|

If the Data Contributor is able to affirm their understanding of this checklist and that the data meet the criteria in this checklist, then the Data Contributor may engage their HTAN Data Liaison to begin the data contribution process. 

If the Data Contributor has concerns about the acceptability of their data contribution, the Data Contributor may contact the HTAN DCC to request Data Contribution Support via the HTAN Help Desk: https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/1

When necessary, a final determination regarding acceptability of data to HTAN DCC will be at the discretion of NCI and the HTAN DCC PIs. If the decision is that the data should not be shared with the HTAN DCC, Sage can work with the Data Contributor to share the data elsewhere in Synapse.
