# Open Access Data

The [HTAN Data Portal](https://humantumoratlas.org/explore) provides an overview of all released data.  For Open Access data, the Portal also provides links to: 
- downloadable files on Synapse;  
- CellxGene and Xena for visualization of single cell RNA-sequencing data; 
- Minerva rendered images and stories; 
- Google BigQuery tables; and 
- cBioPortal. 

Google BigQuery tables provide direct access to a subset of assay data (mainly level 4 files) on a cloud platform.  The Google BigQuery tables provide an easy way to build cohorts using specific data fields.  HTAN also provides sample code for working with the data in Google BigQuery.

!!! For more detailed information about the HTAN Portal, CellxGene, Minerva-rendered Images, accessing Images via SB-CGC and/or Using Google BigQuery, please see the next sections of this manual.
